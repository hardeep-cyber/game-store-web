                Plain text exclusively consists of character representation. Each character is represented by a
                fixed-length
                sequence of one, two, or four bytes, or as a variable-length sequence of one to four bytes, in
                accordance to
                specific character encoding conventions, such as ASCII, ISO/IEC 2022, UTF-8, or Unicode. These
                conventions
                define many printable characters, but also non-printing characters that control the flow of the text,
                such
                as space, line break, and page break. Plain text contains no other information about the text itself,
                not
                even the character encoding convention employed. Plain text is stored in text files, although text files
                do
                not exclusively store plain text. In the early days of computers, plain text was displayed using a
                monospace
                font, such that horizontal alignment and columnar formatting were sometimes done using whitespace
                characters. For compatibility reasons, this tradition has not changed.
